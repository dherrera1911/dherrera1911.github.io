I am a postdoctoral researcher in Computational Neuroscience
at the [Computational Neuroscience Initiative](https://cni.upenn.edu/)
in University of Pennsylvania, with Prof. 
[Johannes Burge](https://jburge.psych.upenn.edu/). I am currently
working on modeling 3D-motion perception with natural stimuli,
modeling the effects of neural variability on divisive
normalization, and applying geometric data analysis tools
to natural image statistics.

I received my PhD in Neuroscience from the [Faculty of Sciences](https://www.fcien.edu.uy/) at
Universidad de la República (UdelaR), Uruguay, during which I
also collaborated with [Ruben Coen-Cagli](https://sites.google.com/site/rubencoencagli/)
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
During my PhD I used psychophysics and computational modeling to
study naturalistic texture perception. Before that, I got my BSc in
Biochemistry, also from UdelaR.

Research interests
======

Natural visual inputs are high dimensional, complex and ambiguous.
However, the brain makes sense of them in order to
perceive the world. I'm interested in understanding what are
the challenges that the brain faces when seeing the natural world,
and how it solves them.

To study these questions, I use computational modeling of
natural image statistics, model visual observers, and
models of the visual system. I am particularly interested in
using probabilistic models, signal processing and
geometrical tools to understand the complexity of 
natural visual inputs. I also have experience using psychophysics
to answer questions about perceptual organization with
naturalistic images.

I am also interested in the use of statistical models to analyze
real world data while accounting for its complexity. Besides
applying these to psychophysical data, I have worked on
analyzing epidemiological data with Bayesian models during the
COVID-19 pandemic, leading to different publications and
technical reports with real-world applicability.

Lastly, I am interested in the use of open science practices
to make research more transparent, reproducible and accessible.


Teaching
======

I have held teaching positions at UdelaR uninterruptedly
from 2013 to 2022, starting when I was an undergraduate student.

I have TAed, lectured, and participated in designing courses
in the fields of biochemistry, neuroscience,
statistics and machine learning, at both the undergraduate
and graduate level. I have also mentored undergraduate students
in year-long research projects.

I am passionate about teaching, and while I am not currently
teaching during my postdoc, I am always looking for opportunities
to teach and mentor students.


Personal interests
======

Outside of research, some of my favorite activities are
surfing, being outdoors, playing music and reading. Also
visiting my home country, [Uruguay](https://uruguaynatural.com/en/),
a hidden gem in South America where I learned to
do science.
