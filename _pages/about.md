I am a postdoctoral researcher 
at the [Computational Neuroscience Initiative](https://cni.upenn.edu/)
in University of Pennsylvania, with Prof. 
[Johannes Burge](https://jburge.psych.upenn.edu/). I work on
computational modeling of visual perception and neural activity,
with a focus on understanding how the brain processes natural
visual inputs.

I received my PhD in Neuroscience from the [Faculty of Sciences](https://www.fcien.edu.uy/) at
Universidad de la República (UdelaR), Uruguay, in collaboration 
with [Ruben Coen-Cagli](https://sites.google.com/site/rubencoencagli/)
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
In my PhD I used psychophysics and computational modeling to
study naturalistic texture perception. Before that, I got my BSc in
Biochemistry, also from UdelaR.

Research interests
======

Natural visual inputs are high dimensional, complex and ambiguous.
However, the brain makes sense of them in order to
perceive the world. I'm interested in understanding what are
the computational challenges of seeing the natural world,
and how the brain solves them.

To study these questions, I use computational modeling of
natural image statistics, of visual observers, and of neural
activity. Some of the tools that I currently use 
include probabilistic models, signal processing and
geometrical data analysis. I have also used psychophysics
to answer questions about perceptual organization with
naturalistic images.

Besides neuroscience, I am interested in statistical modeling
of real world data in general. I have applied Bayesian
modeling to epidemiological data during the
COVID-19 pandemic, leading to different publications and
technical reports with real-world applicability.
I enjoy crossing the boundaries between fields and learning
new skills every so often, within and outside of neuroscience.

Lastly, I am interested in the use of open science practices
to make research more transparent, reproducible and accessible.


Teaching
======

I have held teaching positions at UdelaR uninterruptedly
from 2013 to 2022, and I am passionate about teaching.

I have TA'd, lectured, and participated in designing courses
in the fields of biochemistry, neuroscience,
statistics and machine learning, at both the undergraduate
and graduate level. I have also mentored undergraduate students
in year-long research projects.

Personal interests
======

Outside of research, I enjoy surfing, being outdoors, playing music
and reading. Also visiting my home country, [Uruguay](https://uruguaynatural.com/en/),
a hidden gem in South America where I learned to do science.
