Software
======

I am interested in open-source scientific software development. I try to make my methodological
work available as well-documented, well-tested and easy-to-use Python packages, so that
other researchers can use them in their own work. I also contribute to other open-source packages
in the scientific Python ecosystem.

Packages I authored:

- [**`sqfa`**](https://sqfa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Package implementing my method Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA),
which uses information geometry to do supervised dimensionality reduction
- [**`projnormal`**](https://projnormal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Package implementing my generalizations of the Projected Normal distribution.

Packages I contributed to:
 
- [**`geomstats`**](https://geomstats.github.io/): Package for statistics in Riemannian manifolds, developed
at UC Santa Barbara. I improved the computation of distances in the manifold of positive definite matrices.
- [**`plenoptic`**](https://plenoptic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Package for model-based image synthesis,
developed at the Flatiron Institute, NYC. I improved the characterization of texture statistics, and
added regularized image synthesis.

Technical reports
======
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I participated in UdelaR's
honorary group for COVID-19 data analysis, [GUIAD-COVID-19](https://guiad-covid.github.io/).
There I authored technical reports to serve decision makers in Uruguay.
The reports are hosted in UdelaR's institutional repository, and are
featured in the university's
[Contributions to the COVID-19 response report](https://udelar.edu.uy/portal/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2021/03/La-Universidad-de-la-Republica-frente-al-SARS-CoV-2.pdf).
