## Packages I develop

I am currently developing different PyTorch-based packages for statistical analyses.

- [**`sqfa`**](https://sqfa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A Python package for learning linear features
that maximize second-order differences between classes, using information geometry.
- [**`amatorch`**](https://amatorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A Python package for learning features
that maximize the performance of a probabilistic decoder. One of it uses is to learn ideal observer
models to compare to human perception and visual neurophysiology.
- [**`projected_normal_distribution`**](https://github.com/dherrera1911/projected_normal_distribution): A
Python package implementing several operations for the projected normal distribution, a distribution
defined on the unit N-dimensional sphere.

## Packages I contribute to

I have contributed to the following packages:

- [**`geomstats`**](https://geomstats.github.io/): A Python package for performing computations and
statistical analyses on manifolds.
- [**`plenoptic`**](https://plenoptic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A Python package for model-based
synthesis of perceptual stimuli.
