## Packages I developed

I have developed Python packages implementing some of my work on statistical models
and algorithms. These packages use a PyTorch backend, they are well
documented, and use best practices for software development such as
testing and continuous integration.

- [**`sqfa`**](https://sqfa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A Python package for learning
linear features that maximize second-order differences between classes,
using information geometry.
- [**`projnormal`**](https://projnormal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
A Python package for working with the projected normal distribution in the
N-dimensional sphere.

## Packages I contribute to

I have contributed to the following packages:

- [**`scikit-learn`**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Python package for machine learning.
I incorporated robust covariance estimation into Quadratic Discriminant Analysis ([#32108](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/32108))
and fixed a bias in the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator ([#32117](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/32117)
- [**`geomstats`**](https://geomstats.github.io/): A Python package for performing computations and
statistical analyses on manifolds. I improved the computation of distances between SPD matrices.
- [**`plenoptic`**](https://plenoptic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A Python package for model-based
synthesis of perceptual stimuli. I contributed to refactoring the texture synthesis model.
