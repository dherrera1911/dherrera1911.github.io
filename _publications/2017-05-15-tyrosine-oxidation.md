title: "Tyrosine oxidation and nitration in transmembrane peptides is connected to lipid peroxidation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-05-15-tyrosine-oxidation
excerpt: 'Tyrosine nitration is an oxidative post-translational modification that can occur in proteins associated to hydrophobic bio-structures such as membranes and lipoproteins. In this work, we studied tyrosine nitration in membranes using a model system consisting of liposomes with pre-incorporated tyrosine-containing 23 amino acid transmembrane peptides.'
