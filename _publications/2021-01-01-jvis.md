excerpt: 'In this paper we use psychophysics experiments with Portilla-Simoncelli textures to show that texture segmentation affects contextual modulation in peripheral vision. This flexible contextual modulation cannot be accounted for by popular pooling models of crowding. We probe the relevance of different texture properties to contextual modulation, providing guidance for studying the neural mechanisms of flexible contextual modulation.'

**Abstract**: Peripheral vision comprises most of our visual field, and is essential in guiding visual behavior. Its characteristic capabilities and limitations, which distinguish it from foveal vision, have been explained by the most influential theory of peripheral vision as the product of representing the visual input using summary statistics. Despite its success, this account may provide a limited understanding of peripheral vision, because it neglects processes of perceptual grouping and segmentation. To test this hypothesis, we studied how contextual modulation, namely the modulation of the perception of a stimulus by its surrounds, interacts with segmentation in human peripheral vision. We used naturalistic textures, which are directly related to summary-statistics representations. We show that segmentation cues affect contextual modulation, and that this is not captured by our implementation of the summary-statistics model. We then characterize the effects of different texture statistics on contextual modulation, providing guidance for extending the model, as well as for probing neural mechanisms of peripheral vision.
