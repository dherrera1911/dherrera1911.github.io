[COVID was twice as deadly in poorer countries](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01767-z)
where I was interviewed for commentary. It was also featured in
news media such as [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/madhukarpai/2022/07/12/how-many-variants-and-deaths-are-we-willing-to-accept-before-we-protect-the-whole-world/?ref=altdnt)

**Abstract:**
**Introduction.** The infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 has been carefully measured
and analysed in high-income countries, whereas there has been no systematic analysis of
age-specific seroprevalence or IFR for developing countries. **Methods.** We systematically
reviewed the literature to identify all COVID-19 serology studies in developing countries
that were conducted using representative samples collected by February 2021. For each of
the antibody assays used in these serology studies, we identified data on assay
characteristics, including the extent of seroreversion over time. We analysed the serology
data using a Bayesian model that incorporates conventional sampling uncertainty as well
as uncertainties about assay sensitivity and specificity. We then calculated IFRs using
individual case reports or aggregated public health updates, including age-specific
estimates whenever feasible. **Results.** In most locations in developing countries,
seroprevalence among older adults was similar to that of younger age cohorts, underscoring
the limited capacity that these nations have to protect older age groups. Age-specific IFRs
were roughly 2 times higher than in high-income countries. The median value of the population
IFR was about 0.5%, similar to that of high-income countries, because disparities in
healthcare access were roughly offset by differences in population age structure.
**Conclusion.** The burden of COVID-19 is far higher in developing countries than in
high-income countries, reflecting a combination of elevated transmission to middle-aged and
older adults as well as limited access to adequate healthcare. These results underscore the
critical need to ensure medical equity to populations in developing countries through
provision of vaccine doses and effective medications.
