title: "Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 seroassay sensitivity: a systematic review and modeling study"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-05-eurosurveillance
excerpt: 'Background: Serological surveys have been the gold standard to estimate numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the dynamics of the epidemic, and disease severity. Serological assays have decaying sensitivity with time that can bias their results, but there is a lack of guidelines to account for this phenomenon for SARS-CoV-2. Aim: Our goal was to assess the sensitivity decay of seroassays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections, the dependence of this decay on assay characteristics, and to provide a simple method to correct for this phenomenon. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. We included studies testing previously diagnosed, unvaccinated individuals, and excluded studies of cohorts highly unrepresentative of the general population (e.g. hospitalised patients).'

In this project, we did a systematic meta-analysis of sensitivity data
of serological assay sensitivities for SARS-CoV-2 across time. This
involved collecting a novel dataset of the proportion of positive tests
when testing previously diagnosed individuals. A slightly pre-processed
version of this unique dataset can be found
[here](https://github.com/dherrera1911/seroreversion_metaanalysis/blob/master/data/processed_data/PCR_to_serotest_all.csv).

**Data and code:** The data and code for this project are available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/dherrera1911/seroreversion_metaanalysis/).

**Key public health message:** 
**What did you want to address in this study?**
Knowing how many people get infected with SARS-CoV-2 is important for determining the severity of the virus, herd immunity thresholds and groups at higher risk. To estimate this, results from antibody tests are used. However, antibody levels fall with time after infection, which can make these tests unreliable. We aimed to quantify the reliability of different tests, to understand possible biases in our understanding of COVID-19.
**What have we learnt from this study?**
The change of antibody test reliability through time is very variable, and it depends on assay characteristics. Some assays will give strongly biased estimates of infections a couple of months after an epidemic wave, while others will remain reliable for many months. We provide a tool for researchers to assess the risk that an assay will give biased results, and to quantitatively correct for this effect.
**What are the implications of your findings for public health?**
Because test reliability changes across time, some antibody tests have the potential to strongly bias our understanding of crucial aspects of COVID-19. As this effect varies depending on the test, the reliability of test results needs to be considered in a test-specific way. For future outbreaks and new infectious diseases, it is important that public health agencies provide guidelines and tools to account for this possible bias.
