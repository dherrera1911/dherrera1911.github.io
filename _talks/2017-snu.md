Summary statistics representations of visual inputs are
used to model visual texture perception. These type of
representations are also used to model visual crowding in
peripheral vision, in the so called texture-tiling model of
peripheral vision. Here we probe visual crowding using
naturalistic textures, to test how well the texture-tiling
model can account for perceptual organization in crowding.
