Underascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections is a common problem during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimating the degree of underascertainment can
be challenging, but it is useful for guiding public health responses.
Here we estimate underascertainment across time for Uruguay during
2020, adapting a method developed by Russell et al. (2020) to 
incorporate age-stratified case reports, as well as for using
hospitalization and ICU admission data. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sANL3Mg3vs)
