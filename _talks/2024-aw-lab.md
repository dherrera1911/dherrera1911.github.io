There is growing interest in the geometric analyses of representations
in biological and artificial neural systems. Generally, these
analyses do not consider the stochastic nature of the representations.
Here, we use differential geometry to analyze the geometry of
response statistics in a simple ideal observer model to
naturalistic images across different visual tasks. We find that
different information geometric structures are required for
different analysis goals. [Slides](/files/presentations/geometry_presentation.pdf)
