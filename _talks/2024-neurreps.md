[Extended Abstract](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=vxdPzM18Xx). Supervised
dimensionality reduction seeks to find a low-dimensional feature space that
maximizes the separation between classes. We propose a novel supervised
dimensionality reduction method, Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA),
that exploits the geometry of the data second-order statistics to maximize
second-order class separation.
