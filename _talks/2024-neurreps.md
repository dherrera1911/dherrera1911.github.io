Supervised dimensionality reduction seeks to find a
low-dimensional feature space that maximizes the separation
between classes. We propose a novel supervised dimensionality
reduction method, Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA),
that exploits the geometry of the data second-order statistics to
maximize second-order class separation. [Poster](/files/presentations/neurreps_2024_poster.pdf).
