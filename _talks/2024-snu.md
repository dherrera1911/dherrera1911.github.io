Neural noise is an ubiquitous phenomenon in neural systems.
Better understanding its origins and consequences is crucial for
understanding neural coding. In this talk I explore the relation
between neural noise and divisive normalization. I also discuss
my use of online math forums to develop the mathematics behind
this modeling work.
