(2013-2017) I was a teacher assistant in 1st and 3rd year
biochemistry courses for medical students at Faculty of Medicine,
UdelaR, Uruguay (note, Medicine is not a 4-year graduate degree in Uruguay,
but a 7-year degree). I led discussion groups on topics ranging
from basic physical chemistry (e.g. acid-base equilibria) to,
biochemistry (e.g. enzyme kinetics) to systems physiology
(e.g. digestion). I also led practical laboratory classes on a
variety of topics, and was responsible for preparing
the materials for the practical classes, and to grade
students lab reports.
