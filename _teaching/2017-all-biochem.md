**2013-2016**. I was a teaching assistant in 1st and 3rd year
biochemistry courses for medical students
(note: Medical School is 7 years long in Uruguay, with
years 1 to 3 being equivalent to pre-med undergraduate studies).
I taught topics in physical chemistry, biochemistry and human physiology.
I also led and organized practical laboratory classes on a
variety of topics. This teaching was done in the context of
my teaching position at the
[Biochemistry Department of the Faculty of Medicine](http://www.bioquimica.fmed.edu.uy/Docencia.html).
