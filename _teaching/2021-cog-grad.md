(2021 ) I taught a class on dynamical systems for a graduate
course introducing different mathematical methods to
cognitive science master students. For this, I prepared a
Jupyter notebook with an example of differential equations
used for modeling epidemic dynamics
([link](/files/teaching/other_lectures/epidemias_ecuaciones_diferenciales.ipynb)).
