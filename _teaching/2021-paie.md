**2021.** I mentored 3 undergraduate students in Biology
in a year-long research project, titled
*Neural networks and face masks: Face perception during COVID-19*,
as part of the 
[Program of Support for Student Research](https://www.fing.edu.uy/inco/proyectos/paie/)
at Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay. 
The students were awarded a grant to pursue the project, and
presented their results at the 2022 PAIE conference.
