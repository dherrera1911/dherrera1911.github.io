**2021.** I mentored a team of three Biology undergraduates
in a year-long research project, titled
*Neural networks and face masks: Face perception during COVID-19*.
The students were awarded a grant for the project by the
[Program of Support for Student Research](https://www.fing.edu.uy/inco/proyectos/paie/),
and they presented their results at the 2021 program conference.
