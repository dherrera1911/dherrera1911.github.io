**2021.** I was a teaching assistant in the first edition of this
7-week graduate course. I designed and implemented, with the other TA,
the notebooks for the practical classes
([link to notebooks](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc)),
that include the course evaluations,
and we led those classes. [Course website](https://eva.fing.edu.uy/course/view.php?id=1529)

The course covers basic concepts of machine learning, to
give an overview of the area, while also providing
students with hands-on experience and exercises of
varying difficulty levels.

The notebooks, which are in Spanish, can be found in my
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc).
The list of notebooks is as follows:
* [Class 1: Introduction to ML](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc/blob/master/notebooks/Taller1-Introduccion_AA.ipynb)
* [Class 2: Supervised learning](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc/blob/master/notebooks/Taller2-Aprendizaje_supervisado.ipynb)
* [Class 3: Unsupervised learning](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc/blob/master/notebooks/Taller3-Aprendizaje_no_supervisado.ipynb)
* [Class 4: Representing the data](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc/blob/master/notebooks/Taller4-Representacion_y_modelado.ipynb)
* [Class 5: Neural networks](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc/blob/master/notebooks/Taller5-Redes_neuronales_Random_forests.ipynb)
* [Class 6: Model evaluation](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc/blob/master/notebooks/Taller6-Evaluacion_de_modelos.ipynb)
* [Class 7: Applications, spike sorting](https://github.com/dherrera1911/talleres_aabc/blob/master/notebooks/Taller7-Aplicaciones.ipynb)
