(2017-onwards) Course for starting biology and biochemistry students
at Faculty of Sciences, UdelaR, Uruguay.
I teach a lecture and discussion group on perception science.

A [book by the same name](https://pmb.parlamento.gub.uy/pmb/opac_css/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=102927)
was published by the course coordinators for use in the course
and aimed at a broader audience. I taught a lecture titled
*Is the world as we see it?*, discussing broad concepts in
perception science and neuroscience through the guiding
question of whether our perception of the world is a
faithful representation of reality, and wrote a chapter
for the book on the same topic. Concepts of the class
are then discussed around optical illusions in a
discussion group.

Some materials I have prepared for this course are:
  * [Slides for the lecture](/files/teaching/hym/vision_hym.pdf)
