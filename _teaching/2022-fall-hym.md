**2017-2024.** I teach a lecture and a discussion class about
perception science in this course for first and second year biology students.
I also wrote a chapter for the
[book by the same name as the course](https://pmb.parlamento.gub.uy/pmb/opac_css/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=102927),
published by the course coordinators. The chapter,
found [here](/files/teaching/hym/capitulo_hym_dh.pdf), is titled
*Is the world as we see it?* and discusses broad concepts in
perception and neuroscience, accessible to a general
educated audience.

In the lecture I taught, also titled
*Is the world as we see it?*, we discuss broad concepts in
perception science and neuroscience through the guiding
question of whether our perception of the world is a
faithful representation of reality. Concepts of the class
are then discussed around optical illusions in a
discussion group.

Some materials I have prepared for this course are:
  * [Slides for the lecture](/files/teaching/hym/vision_hym.pdf)
  * [Chapter for the book](/files/teaching/hym/capitulo_hym_dh.pdf)
  * [Discussion group materials](/files/teaching/hym/discusion_hym.pdf)
