(2017-2022) Course for advanced biology and biochemistry undergraduate
students at Faculty of Sciences, UdelaR, Uruguay. I taught lectures
on molecular and biophysical basis of neuronal electrophysiology,
a simulation lab, and led discussion groups.

I designed a three-class neuron biophysics simulation lab using the
[NEURON simulator](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/),
with exercises to be done.

Some materials I have prepared for this course are:
  * Neuron biophysics simulation lab:
    * [Lab 1: Spherical isopotential cell](/files/teaching/neuro_basica/guia_NEURON1.pdf)
    * [Lab 2: Dendrites and axons](/files/teaching/neuro_basica/guia_NEURON2.pdf)
    * [Lab 3: Real cell geometry and ion channels](/files/teaching/neuro_basica/guia_NEURON3.pdf)
    * [Video tutorial on how to use NEURON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwMERyYIshw)
  * Ion channel biophysics lecture:
    * [Slides lecture 1](/files/teaching/neuro_basica/canales1.pdf)
    * [Slides lecture 2](/files/teaching/neuro_basica/canales2.pdf)
  * Guide for neuron excitation biophysics
