**2024.** I mentored a team of three undergraduate students
(from biology and psychology) in a year-long research project
titled *Deep Convolutional Neural Networks as models of the visual system*.
The students were awarded a grant for the project by the
[Program of Support for Student Research](https://www.fing.edu.uy/inco/proyectos/paie/).
See the student's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/karenLS3/paie-cnn-visual-system-modeling) for the project.
