**2024.** I currently mentor 3 undergraduate students in Biology and
Psychology in a year-long research project with
neural networks, as part of the 
[Program of Support for Student Research](https://www.fing.edu.uy/inco/proyectos/paie/).
The project is titled *Deep Convolutional Neural Networks as models of the visual system*,
and it aims to compare the changes in selectivity and invariance
across layers of a CNN to the changes in selectivity and invariance
across areas of the primate visual system. The students
were awarded a grant to pursue the project.
